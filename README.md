# Rendering-Engine
This repository contains the code I wrote as part of my fifth semester at university, studying Computer Games Technoloy. 
It is probably my most complex and most interesting project of my bachelors degree.
The project was to implement an advanced rendering engine using OpenGL and C.
The engine is able to render complex scene with advanced light and shadow calculations, tessellation, and much more.
